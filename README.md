##  Project Overview

This is a console-based **Singly Linked List Management System** written in C that demonstrates fundamental operations on a linked list using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

The program offers a **menu-driven interface** where the user can:

- Insert a node at the **front**, **end**, or **a specific position**
- Delete a node from the **front**, **end**, or **a specific position**
- Display the linked list at any stage
- Continuously perform operations until the user exits
